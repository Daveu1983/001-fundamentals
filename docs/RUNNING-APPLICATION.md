# Running your code

The next section outlines how to run the code and get your Javascript tests executing.

Before we dive in to the code lets first understand the folder and file structure so we know where everything is.

**NOTE:** Sometimes techies will use the word '**directories**' when referring to **folders** on your laptop.

## Exploring the files

By now Visual Studio Code should be open and you can see your code. If this isn't the case please go back to the [pre-requisites documentation](./PRE-REQUISITES.md) and follow through the steps.
