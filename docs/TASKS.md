# Coding Tasks

**Note**

Where applicable, try to do the coding tasks with ping pong [pair programming](http://wiki.c2.com/?PairProgrammingPingPongPattern). 

For example, in your pairs, person A could do task 2, observe that the test fails because task 3 has not been completed. 

Person B then implements the code for task 3. 

You then re-run the test and find that it passes.

Then Person B writes the test and code for task 4.

Person A writes the code and implements the function for task 5 and so on and so on.

## 1) Enhancing your package.json

Update your package.json and get it list out files and directories when you run `npm run show-all-files`

You should see something like the following:

```
LICENSE           README.md         app               docs              package-lock.json package.json      test
```

**Hint**

Go back to your command line lecture notes and the command for listing files

## 2) Write the test for a subtract function

Add a new test that will check that the calculator now supports a subtract function.

**Hint**

At this stage the test should FAIL.

## 3) Implement the subtract function

Update your application to implement a new function that will subtract two numbers and return the result.

The test from task 2 should now pass.

## 4) Write a test for a multiply function

Add a new test that will check that the calculator now supports a multiply function.

**Hint**

At this stage the test should FAIL.

## 5) Write a test for a multiply function

Update your application to implement a new function that will multiply two numbers and return the result.

The test from task 4 should now pass.


# Written questions

The following questions are intended to be answered with written answers (no coding required) and should re-enforce some of the learning you have completed.

1) Which part is the file extension of the package.json file?

2) What does JSON stand for?

3) What is the purpose of JSON?
