# Coding Tasks

**Note**

Where applicable, try to do the coding tasks with [ping pong pair programming](http://wiki.c2.com/?PairProgrammingPingPongPattern).

For example, in your pairs, person A could do task 2, observe that the test fails because task 3 has not been completed.

Person B then implements the code for task 3.

You then re-run the test and find that it passes.

Then Person B writes the test and code for task 4.

Person A writes the code and implements the function for task 5 and so on and so on.

## 1) Download the ESLint extension for VSCode

We use a tool called a Linter. A linter will identify when we have incorrectly formatted our code, or when it suspects we have an error such as an undefined variable.

We use a tool called [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).

You can run:

    npm run eslint

to see whether ESLint suspects you have made any errors. It is recommended to do this regularly, so you can fix problems as you go along.

Also, **install the ESLint extension for VSCode**, which will provide in-line error checking (by underlining any problems in red squiggly lines, like in a Word document). Click the square symbol on the left hand bar for extensions.

## 2) Enhancing your package.json

Update your package.json and get it to list out files and directories when you run `npm run show-all-files`

You should see something like the following:

```
LICENSE           README.md         app               docs              package-lock.json package.json      test
```

**Hint**

Go back to your command line lecture notes and the command for listing files

## 3) Write the test for a subtract function

Add a new test that will check that the calculator now supports a subtract function.

**Hint**

At this stage the test should FAIL.

## 4) Implement the subtract function

Update your application to implement a new function that will subtract two numbers and return the result.

The test from task 3 should now pass.

## 5) Write a test for a multiply function

Add a new test that will check that the calculator now supports a multiply function.

**Hint**

At this stage the test should FAIL.

## 6) Implement the multiply function

Update your application to implement a new function that will multiply two numbers and return the result.

The test from task 5 should now pass.

## 7) Write a test for an isOdd function

Add a new test that will check that the calculator now supports an isOdd function that will return `true` if the number passed to it is odd, and `false` if the number passed to it is even.

**Hint**

At this stage the test should FAIL.

## 8) Implement the isOdd function

Update your application to implement the isOdd function

The test from task 7 should now pass.

## 9) Write a test for an isEven function

Add a new test that will check that the calculator now supports an isEven function that will return `true` if the number passed to it is even, and `false` if the number passed to it is even.

**Hint**

At this stage the test should FAIL.

## 10) Implement the isEven function

Update your application to implement the isEven function

The test from task 9 should now pass.

## 11) Write a test for an divisibleBy function

Add a new test that will check that the calculator now supports a divisibleBy function which takes two arguments and returns `true` if the first number can be divided evenly by the second.

e.g.

`calculator.divisibleBy(10, 2)` --> `true`
`calculator.divisibleBy(13, 7)` --> `false`

**Hint**

At this stage the test should FAIL.

## 12) Implement the divisibleBy function

Update your application to implement the divisibleBy function.

The test from task 11 should now pass.

## 13) Write a test for a square function

Add a new test that will check that the calculator now supports a square function that returns the square of the number passed to it.

**Hint**

At this stage the test should FAIL.

## 14) Implement the square function

Update your application to implement the square function.

The test from task 13 should now pass.
