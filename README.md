# Week 1 - Programming Fundamentals

## Introduction

Welcome everyone to Week 1 of your course!

The following instructions are provided to help you get to grips with some initial programming fundamentals.

Although we focus on the Javascript language, the structures and approaches you learn over the next exercises are applicable to all programming languages. The main thing that changes between languages is the [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax).

For example if your 1st language is English and you visit Greece - when you visit a restaurant you may speak in Greek to place your food order. The structure of the sentence is very different to English. It is **syntactically** different. However the outcome and target of what you want to achieve, order an amazing meal, is the same whether you order in English or Greek.

In the coding exercises we just _choose_ to teach Javascript in the same way that you might have just _chose_ to speak in Greek.

## Technology

We'll be making use of the Javascript programming language within a [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) environment and utilising a test framework called [Jest]( https://jestjs.io/en/) to run our code.

## Instructions

### Pre-Requisites

By this stage you should already be comfortable with the command line and have your cheat sheet of commands.

We're going to build on that knowledge and use the command line again in order to get your environment (laptop) ready.

#### 1) Download Visual Studio Code

When writing software, developers use tools to help them. One of those tools is known as an Integrated Development Environment or IDE for short. This is a tool that helps the developer when writing code.

You use an IDE to write software in the same way that you might use Microsoft Word to produce a document.

On this course we use a tool called Visual Studio Code to support our writing of code. So firstly head over to their website to [download and install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
